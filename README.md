# Neighborhood Maps

### What is this?
This is a React based project which displays relevant info about a specific neighborhood. In this case, I chose to show the various 'fine-dining' establishments in Kansas City, Mo (technically they are dive bars).


### Let's get set up
1. Clone this repo by typing `git clone https://github.com/kylegeary/neighborhood-map.git` in your computer's terminal
2. After its cloned, run npm install
3. To see the app in action, run npm start


### What else should you know?
 - I am using a service worker from create-react-app, which only functions in a production build. To use a production build, run 'yarn build' while in the project. This will create an optimized build and provide instructions on deploying the project wherever you'd like (make sure you install yarn first by using `NPM install yarn`).

 You can read about service workers in create-react-app here -> `https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/making-a-progressive-web-app`
