# Neighborhood Maps

### What is this?
This is a React based project which displays relevant info about a specific neighborhood. In this case, I chose to show the various 'fine-dining' establishments in Kansas City, Mo (technically they are dive bars).


### Let's get set up
1. Clone this repo by typing `git clone https://github.com/kylegeary/neighborhood-map.git` in your computer's terminal
2. After its cloned, run npm install
3. To see the app in action, run npm start


### What else should you know?
 - I am using a service worker from create-react-app, which only functions in a production build. You can read about service workers in create-react-app here -> `https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/making-a-progressive-web-app`
